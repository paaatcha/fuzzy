# Fuzzy numbers

This repository has my implementations of the Fuzzy Numbers and the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Number.
They can be used to implement, for instance, a fuzzy classifier or a fuzzy decision making algorithm (like Fuzzy TODIM, Fuzzy TOPSIS etc. Check my decision making repository)

If you find any bug or have any comment, feel free to email me.
